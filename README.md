# ChatBot_IntentClassification

### Introduction
It is an indisputable fact that the Covid-19 spread is one of the most negatively impactful pandemic of world history. The spread began in end of the year 2019 and it's been more than a year now, However, apart from all the awareness campaigns and notices from the government, still few of the individuals have no basic knowledge about it. To solve this problem, I and my team have developed an awareness chatbot for coronavirus. This chatbot can educate people about the coronavirus and will raise awareness among them.

### Problem Statement
